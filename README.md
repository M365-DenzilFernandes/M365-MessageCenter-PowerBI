# M365-MessageCenter-PowerBI

A Power BI Report to connect to the Office 365 Service Communications API

This report contains a data query which connects to the Office 365 Service Communications API and query the following from the API:

* Get Current Status: Get current service status including any incidents
* Get Messages: Get Incidents, Planned Maintenance, and Message Centre communications.
* Get Historical Status: Get historic service status including any incidents
* Get Services: Get the list of subscribed services

As it's pre-configured to query my development tenant, you only need to update the tenant id, client id and client secret.
